This project leverages machine learning to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. This repository uses the enhanced dataset from Kaggle and the Titanic Wiki with a lot of missing values added back in. 
The project implements a feature engineering pipeline to preprocess the data, followed by a hyperparameter-tuned XGBoost Classifier with Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation for robust evaluation.
